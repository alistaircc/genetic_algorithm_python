Create a generic program whose population size = 50 (individuals), crossover-rate = 0.7 and mutation rate = (0.001). 

For this generic algorithm assignment the goal was to create a generic program whose population size = 50 (individuals), crossover-rate = 0.7 and mutation rate = (0.001). Each individual within the population was made up of binary bits of 1s and 0s and was 10 indexes in length. Utilizing functions: randomGenome, makePopulation, fitness, evaluateFitness, selectPair, crossover, mutate and a supporting function of replacePopulation, the program ran until 30 generations were create or a best fitness score = 10.0 (i.e individual containing ten 1s was seen) which ever one came first.
